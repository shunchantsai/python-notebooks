🧠 WHY This Works
* Focuses on one coastal city (e.g. London, Rotterdam, Jakarta, or New York).
* Uses readily available data (OpenStreetMap, Copernicus, WorldPop, IPCC).
* Centers on flood risk assessment + basic resilience indicators, not full resilience modeling or stochastic simulation.

    * A basic loss proxy (e.g., affected road length or buildings)

4. Add Simple Resilience Indicators
Examples:
* Presence of levees/sea walls (visual or mapped)
* Land use: Is critical infrastructure located in low-risk areas?
* Social resilience proxy: GDP per capita, literacy rate, or public health access
* Use a simple scorecard or table to communicate findings.

5. Create Outputs for Communication

Example 2:

✅ A hybrid model that uses MCMC for flood model calibration, followed by a machine learning emulator trained on validated outputs to simulate probabilistic future flood damage scenarios.


🧠 WHY This Topic Is Valuable

This project reflects how flood modeling is actually done in catastrophe (CAT) modeling today — a balance of physics-based simulation, probabilistic calibration, and machine learning for speed and scalability. It mirrors what re/insurers and vendors like RMS and Verisk do, and it aligns perfectly with your goal of working in the insurance/finance space.

Why it’s powerful:
* MCMC helps explore uncertainty in input parameters (e.g., soil permeability, roughness, precipitation intensity).
* ML emulator dramatically speeds up model execution once calibrated — crucial for running ensembles across portfolios and climate scenarios.
* Probabilistic flood risk outputs are required for regulatory, underwriting, and pricing purposes (e.g., Solvency II, IFRS 17).
* Combines explainability (MCMC + physics) with efficiency (ML emulator).

🛠️ WHAT You Can Do (Step-by-Step)

1. Define a Simple But Realistic Flood Model
* Choose a 1D/2D hydraulic model (e.g., MIKE SHE, LISFLOOD-FP, or even a simplified Python rainfall-runoff model).
* Identify key uncertain input parameters (e.g., Manning’s n, initial soil moisture, precipitation intensity).

2. Use MCMC for Parameter Calibration
* Calibrate the model using observed flood events (e.g., from river gauges or satellite data).
* Implement MCMC (e.g., using PyMC, emcee) to sample input parameters that best match observations.
* Output: a set of posterior parameter distributions capturing uncertainty.

3. Run Model Simulations Based on Calibrated Parameters
* Generate hundreds/thousands of simulations from the MCMC samples.
* Collect outputs like water depth, extent, or flow velocity at key locations.

4. Train a Machine Learning Emulator
* Input: MCMC-sampled parameters and/or precipitation fields.
* Output: Model-predicted flood depth/extent/damage.
* Train models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or shallow neural networks to approximate the simulation outputs.
* Validate accuracy on held-out simulations.

5. Apply to Future Scenarios
Use your emulator to simulate flood impacts for:
* New rainfall fields (e.g., from stochastic weather generators or RCP climate scenarios)
* New exposure maps (e.g., urban expansion).
* Generate stochastic event sets and compute metrics like:
    * Expected Annual Damage (EAD)
    * Loss Exceedance Curves
    * Return Period Damage Estimates

6. Visualize and Interpret
* Use GIS tools (e.g., QGIS, Python with Folium/Matplotlib) to visualize inundation and risk maps.
* Quantify and communicate uncertainty in model results — key for actuarial and underwriting decisions.

🌍 PhD dissertation idea

“Assessing Flood Risk and Resilience for Coastal Cities Worldwide Using Geospatial Data, Hazard Models, and Exposure-Vulnerability Analytics”

⸻

🧠 WHY This Topic Is Valuable

Coastal cities are on the frontlines of climate change. With rising sea levels, storm surge, and rapid urbanization, understanding and managing flood risk has become critical for:
* Re/insurers pricing coastal flood risk (e.g., for underwriting or ILS models)
* Governments and NGOs planning adaptation
* Investors and banks evaluating physical climate risk (e.g., under TCFD/IFRS/CSRD)
* Urban planners and infrastructure developers seeking resilience

It’s a truly interdisciplinary space — combining environmental science, geospatial analysis, catastrophe modeling, finance, and data science.

⸻

💡 Why It’s Powerful
* Brings together global flood hazard maps (e.g., Fathom, Aqueduct, Copernicus) with exposure data (e.g., population, critical infrastructure).
* Enables comparative risk assessment across different coastal cities under climate change.
* Aligns with industry frameworks: insurers use similar methods to assess global portfolios.
* Demonstrates resilience analytics — not just where flooding happens, but how systems withstand and recover from it.
* Easily integrated with open-source tools, and highly scalable, so ideal for a dissertation + portfolio showcase.

⸻

🛠️ WHAT You Can Do (Step-by-Step)

1. Select Coastal Cities for Study
* Choose ~5–10 cities across different continents (e.g., New York, Mumbai, Lagos, Jakarta, Rotterdam).
* Criteria: population density, flood hazard, data availability.

2. Compile Hazard Data
* Use global datasets:
    * Coastal flood hazard maps (e.g., from Fathom Global, Aqueduct, ECMWF/Copernicus).
    * Sea-level rise projections (IPCC AR6, NASA SLR viewer).
    * Tropical cyclone tracks (IBTrACS).

3. Collect Exposure and Vulnerability Data
* Population, built environment, land use:
    * WorldPop, OpenStreetMap, GHSL.
* Infrastructure types (e.g., schools, hospitals, ports).
* Social vulnerability indicators (e.g., UNDRR/INFORM index, HDI).

4. Model Flood Risk
Overlay hazard + exposure + vulnerability.
Calculate:
* Expected annual population/damage exposed
* Depth-damage curves (if economic loss data available)
* Flood risk under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios
* Optionally: run return period analysis if you simulate stochastic surge + SLR.

5. Assess Resilience
* Resilience = risk coping + adaptive capacity.
* Use indicators like
    * % of urban area with protective infrastructure
    * Recovery time (based on past event case studies or proxies)
    * Social safety nets, GDP per capita, etc.
* Could include a resilience scorecard per city.

6. Visualize and Compare
* Use geospatial dashboards or static maps.
* Create risk ranking or resilience quadrants:
    * High Risk – Low Resilience (e.g., Jakarta)
    * High Risk – High Resilience (e.g., Rotterdam)
    * Low Risk – High Resilience (e.g., Tokyo)
    * Low Risk – Low Resilience (e.g., small island states)

7. Optional Advanced Extensions
* Integrate with machine learning for flood susceptibility modeling (e.g., logistic regression or XGBoost with DEM, rainfall, LULC).
* Use climate model downscaling to generate new hazard scenarios.
* Apply optimization: e.g., where best to place levees or elevate buildings for cost-effective resilience
