Yes — your 7-year plan is very well-designed to prepare you for consulting roles in firms like Bain/BCG/McKinsey, CAT modeling firms, or even multilateral development banks and insurers. You’ve built in the exact mix of:

⸻

🎯 Core Competencies Needed in Strategy & Technical Consulting:
Skill Area	Your Plan	Relevance to Consulting
Quantitative Rigor	A-level Maths, Further Maths, stats, STEP prep	Consultants must handle models, forecasts, cost-benefit analysis, even regression outputs
Technical & Programming	Python, Git, version control, AWS, data pipeline tools, fluid dynamics, emulator methods	Vital for data-driven projects, especially in CAT modeling, insurance analytics, and digital transformation
Business Acumen	ACCA papers (BT, MA, FA), IFRS, Solvency II, insurance law, A-level Economics	Excellent for understanding financial modeling, P&L analysis, risk/return, and speaking the “language” of business clients
Communication & Soft Skills	FT/NPR podcasts, project presentation skills, strategic storytelling (future development)	Critical for slide decks, client discussions, stakeholder alignment, and internal pitches
Domain Expertise	Flood modeling, environmental risk, carbon accounting, hydrology, uncertainty & decision-making	Big differentiator if you apply to roles in ESG, infra consulting, international development, or climate risk
Project Experience	Planned capstone, version-controlled projects, industry placement year	Mirrors consulting workflows: scoped work, deadlines, stakeholder needs, written and oral outputs

🔄 What You’re Still Building (and Should Focus On):
Area	How to Strengthen
Storytelling with data	Practice writing memos, slide decks, and structured recommendations from messy data — not just coding. Think like a strategist.
Strategic frameworks	Learn frameworks used by consultants (e.g. MECE, issue trees, 3Cs/4Ps, SWOT, value chain). Start applying them.
Case interview prep (if aiming for MBB)	Closer to Year 3, start practicing market sizing, profitability, and decision-tree problems
Client-facing presence	Intern, TA, volunteer — any experience where you simplify complex issues for non-experts will help.

✅ By Year 5–6 (End of BSc / Placement Year), You Could Target:
	•	Entry-level roles at consulting firms (MBB, Big4, Kearney, Oliver Wyman)
	•	Strategy roles in reinsurers, CAT model vendors (e.g. RMS, Verisk, Oasis LMF)
	•	Data/analytics roles in government or multilateral agencies (e.g. FCDO, UNDP)
	•	ESG/data advisory positions in infra, environment, or finance firms

	•	Catastrophe modeling
	•	Climate risk advisory
	•	Environmental finance
	•	Insurance & reinsurance analytics
	•	Sustainability consulting
	•	Data-driven public policy or ESG strategy

🌏 Navigating the Cultural Difference

If you’re working internationally or planning to work in London later, here’s how you might approach it:
	1.	Diplomatic honesty:
“I understand this might complicate the messaging, but omitting uncertainty could undermine the reliability of our report.”
	2.	Shared accountability:
“Perhaps we can flag this uncertainty clearly but briefly, so we stay transparent without overwhelming the client.”
	3.	Offer options:
“Would it make sense to include a short note or visual that captures the uncertainty range?”

✨ Bridging East and West
	•	In Taiwan: Learn how to respectfully raise questions or suggest alternatives without seeming confrontational.
	•	In the UK: Learn how to own your judgement and respectfully push back when ethics or accuracy are at stake.
