Great! Here‚Äôs a typical post-MSc pathway to becoming a fully qualified CAT (catastrophe) modeler, focusing on certification, platform training, and professional development:

‚∏ª

üß© Post-MSc Path to Full CAT Modeler Qualification

Target Timeline: ~1‚Äì2 years after MSc

	‚Ä¢	Tasks:
	‚Ä¢	Work under senior modelers
	‚Ä¢	Assist in model validation, data prep, and scenario analysis
	‚Ä¢	Gain exposure to:
	‚Ä¢	Property exposure datasets
	‚Ä¢	Reinsurance contracts
	‚Ä¢	Loss modeling tools

‚úÖ Step 2: Core Platform Training (within 6‚Äì12 months)
	‚Ä¢	Oasis LMF (open-source platform)
	‚Ä¢	Setup, model execution, and pipeline building
	‚Ä¢	GitHub + Python workflows
	‚Ä¢	RMS (Risk Management Solutions)
	‚Ä¢	Learn to use RiskLink / RiskBrowser
	‚Ä¢	Understand perils, vulnerability modules, financial structures
	‚Ä¢	AIR Worldwide (now Verisk Extreme Event Solutions)
	‚Ä¢	Touchstone / Touchstone Re for loss modeling

‚úÖ Step 3: Certification & Upskilling (within 1‚Äì2 years)
	‚Ä¢	RMS Certified Catastrophe Risk Analyst (CCRA)
A recognized certification in the industry
	‚Ä¢	Exam covers hazard, exposure, vulnerability, financial modeling
	‚Ä¢	Useful for internal promotion and external credibility
	‚Ä¢	Additional Courses:
	‚Ä¢	Insurance-linked securities (ILS) & reinsurance basics
	‚Ä¢	SQL + Python for modeling automation
	‚Ä¢	Cloud computing tools: AWS / Azure in model deployment
	‚Ä¢	Geospatial skills: QGIS / GeoPandas / hazard layer mapping

‚úÖ Step 4: Mid-Level Progression (Year 2+)
	‚Ä¢	Start specializing (e.g., flood risk, climate perils, cyber risk)
	‚Ä¢	Take on model calibration, scenario design, or model validation
	‚Ä¢	Collaborate with actuaries, underwriters, and data scientists

üß≠ When to Study ODEs/PDEs During Your BSc

Year	Focus	Should You Study ODEs/PDEs Now?	Rationale
Year 1	Core DS foundation (Python, stats, calculus, linear algebra)	‚ùå Not yet	Focus on your base ‚Äî too early unless you‚Äôve already mastered calculus.
Year 2	Intermediate ML, stats, start small DS projects	‚úÖ Light ODEs (1st-order, applications)	Ideal time to learn modeling with time-dependent processes (e.g., basic hydrology, disease spread, etc.)
Year 3	Specialize, research projects, career focus	‚úÖ‚úÖ Full PDEs	Perfect timing to study PDEs in context (e.g., flood simulation, hazard propagation). Use in dissertation or capstone project.

üìò What to Study (and When)

üü¢ Year 2 ‚Äì Light ODEs (1st & 2nd order)

Goal: Understand how processes evolve over time (rainfall ‚Üí runoff ‚Üí flood)

Topics:
	‚Ä¢	Separable and linear ODEs
	‚Ä¢	Euler‚Äôs method (numerical solution)
	‚Ä¢	Population dynamics, tank models
	‚Ä¢	Coupling with agent behavior (e.g., evacuation timing)

Resources:
	‚Ä¢	MIT OCW 18.03 (Differential Equations)
	‚Ä¢	Khan Academy: ODEs module
	‚Ä¢	Python: scipy.integrate.odeint for simulating systems

‚∏ª

üîµ Year 3 ‚Äì PDEs and Environmental Applications

Goal: Simulate spatial processes ‚Äî flood spread, pollutant dispersion, terrain runoff

Topics:
	‚Ä¢	Diffusion equation (flood spread)
	‚Ä¢	Heat equation (risk propagation)
	‚Ä¢	Wave equation (e.g., storm surge modeling)
	‚Ä¢	Boundary conditions
	‚Ä¢	Finite difference methods for numerical solutions

Resources:
	‚Ä¢	MIT OCW 18.152 (PDEs)
	‚Ä¢	Book: Introduction to Partial Differential Equations by K. Sankara Rao
	‚Ä¢	Learn to couple with raster/DEM data via numpy, rasterio, xarray

‚∏ª

üß† Bonus: How to Integrate into Your BSc Projects
	‚Ä¢	Summer after Year 2: Build a Python model simulating water level over time (using ODEs + SLR inputs).
	‚Ä¢	Final Year Project: Use PDEs to model flood extent and link it with behavioral ABM (Mesa) for coastal resilience.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Final Advice
	‚Ä¢	You don‚Äôt need a full applied maths degree, but you do need enough ODEs/PDEs to interface with physical models and interpret their outputs.
	‚Ä¢	Learning these gives you credibility and flexibility to work across hydrological modeling, climate risk, and infrastructure simulation ‚Äî all vital in CAT modeling.
