Put the below into Year 4-7 of the 7 year monthly plan. Then present the monthly plan of all 7 Years to me. Make sure to include Headings of Year 1, Year 2, Year 3 to Year 7 above the appropriate months. 

Make sure to lose no details or tasks that need to be complete:

Your Year 4 Financial Literacy Plan (Light but Consistent)

1. Weekly Routine
‚Ä¢ 1 FT article per day (Mon‚ÄìFri)
‚Ä¢ Weekends: Pick one in-depth article (e.g., Big Read, or sector report)
‚Ä¢ 1 concept per week to dive deeper into (e.g., bonds, reinsurance, inflation, derivatives)
‚Ä¢ Monthly reflection journal (track what confused you at first but now makes sense)

2. Termly Goals
‚Ä¢ Term 1: Core financial terms + industry players (central banks, regulators, insurers, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Term 2: How insurance, risk, and finance intersect (especially climate and CAT risk)
‚Ä¢ Term 3: Financial data analysis using Python or Excel (small side project like visualizing flood risk + insurance costs)

3. Learn in Context
‚Ä¢ Connect financial topics to what you‚Äôre studying in data science, maths, or catastrophe modeling. This makes them click faster.
‚Ä¢ e.g., link a regression model to how insurers estimate expected loss


Year 5 Financial Literacy Plan (Deeper & Practical)

‚Ä¢ Summarize it in 3 bullet points for your notes or GitHub repo

2. Monthly Focus Topics
‚Ä¢ October ‚Äì Reinsurance:
