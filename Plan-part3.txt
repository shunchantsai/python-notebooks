Yes — your 7-year plan is very well-designed to prepare you for consulting roles in firms like Bain/BCG/McKinsey, CAT modeling firms, or even multilateral development banks and insurers. You’ve built in the exact mix of:

⸻

🎯 Core Competencies Needed in Strategy & Technical Consulting:
Skill Area	Your Plan	Relevance to Consulting
Quantitative Rigor	A-level Maths, Further Maths, stats, STEP prep	Consultants must handle models, forecasts, cost-benefit analysis, even regression outputs
Technical & Programming	Python, Git, version control, AWS, data pipeline tools, fluid dynamics, emulator methods	Vital for data-driven projects, especially in CAT modeling, insurance analytics, and digital transformation
Business Acumen	ACCA papers (BT, MA, FA), IFRS, Solvency II, insurance law, A-level Economics	Excellent for understanding financial modeling, P&L analysis, risk/return, and speaking the “language” of business clients
Communication & Soft Skills	FT/NPR podcasts, project presentation skills, strategic storytelling (future development)	Critical for slide decks, client discussions, stakeholder alignment, and internal pitches
Domain Expertise	Flood modeling, environmental risk, carbon accounting, hydrology, uncertainty & decision-making	Big differentiator if you apply to roles in ESG, infra consulting, international development, or climate risk
Project Experience	Planned capstone, version-controlled projects, industry placement year	Mirrors consulting workflows: scoped work, deadlines, stakeholder needs, written and oral outputs

🔄 What You’re Still Building (and Should Focus On):
Area	How to Strengthen
Storytelling with data	Practice writing memos, slide decks, and structured recommendations from messy data — not just coding. Think like a strategist.
Strategic frameworks	Learn frameworks used by consultants (e.g. MECE, issue trees, 3Cs/4Ps, SWOT, value chain). Start applying them.
Case interview prep (if aiming for MBB)	Closer to Year 3, start practicing market sizing, profitability, and decision-tree problems
Client-facing presence	Intern, TA, volunteer — any experience where you simplify complex issues for non-experts will help.

✅ By Year 5–6 (End of BSc / Placement Year), You Could Target:
	•	Entry-level roles at consulting firms (MBB, Big4, Kearney, Oliver Wyman)
	•	Strategy roles in reinsurers, CAT model vendors (e.g. RMS, Verisk, Oasis LMF)
	•	Data/analytics roles in government or multilateral agencies (e.g. FCDO, UNDP)
	•	ESG/data advisory positions in infra, environment, or finance firms

	•	Catastrophe modeling
	•	Climate risk advisory
	•	Environmental finance
	•	Insurance & reinsurance analytics
	•	Sustainability consulting
	•	Data-driven public policy or ESG strategy

🌏 Navigating the Cultural Difference

If you’re working internationally or planning to work in London later, here’s how you might approach it:
	1.	Diplomatic honesty:
“I understand this might complicate the messaging, but omitting uncertainty could undermine the reliability of our report.”
	2.	Shared accountability:
“Perhaps we can flag this uncertainty clearly but briefly, so we stay transparent without overwhelming the client.”
	3.	Offer options:
“Would it make sense to include a short note or visual that captures the uncertainty range?”

✨ Bridging East and West
	•	In Taiwan: Learn how to respectfully raise questions or suggest alternatives without seeming confrontational.
	•	In the UK: Learn how to own your judgement and respectfully push back when ethics or accuracy are at stake.


🧠 Summary of What You’d Still Need After MSc
Exam Stage	What You’ll Likely Still Take
Core Practices	CP1 (Actuarial Practice), CP2 (Modelling), CP3 (Communication)
Specialist Principles	✅ SP7 (GI Reserving), ✅ SP8 (GI Pricing)
Specialist Advanced	SA3 (General Insurance) — optional, depending on desired qualification status
Work Experience	3 years of qualifying actuarial work under supervision (Personal and Professional Development — PPD)

🎯 Final Goal: FIA (Fellow of the IFoA)

To become a Fellow of the IFoA (FIA) — the full qualification — you need:
Requirement	Status After MSc
Core Principles	✅ Exempted from most via MSc (e.g., CS1, CM1, CB1)
Core Practices	❌ Must complete (CP1–3)
Specialist Principles (SPx)	❌ Must complete two (e.g., SP7 + SP8)
Specialist Advanced (SAx)	✅ Optional (recommended for FIA)
3 Years PPD	❌ Must complete during work experience


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ What You Can Start Doing Now

1. Practice translating analysis into brief insights.
After finishing a data task or analysis, write a short summary answering:
	•	Why does this matter?
	•	What are the implications for decision-makers?
	•	What options should they consider now?

2. Study how donors or institutions frame problems.
Look at reports or project evaluations from:
	•	FCDO, World Bank, UNDP, Asian Development Bank
Note how they link technical analysis to strategic priorities like resilience, equity, or governance.

3. Use frameworks to guide your messaging.
Start learning frameworks like:
	•	SWOT, PESTLE, or Theory of Change
	•	Cost-benefit framing or scenario comparison in risk consulting

4. Get better at narrative and visual storytelling.
Practice simplifying your findings into 1–2 clear slides:
	•	Big headline + 1–2 charts or maps + takeaway message
This helps when you present to non-technical stakeholders or executives.

🧠 Why It Matters in Consulting

In real-world consulting or donor advisory, data is only half the story. The other half is:
	•	Knowing what the client wants (or fears),
	•	Knowing what donors will fund (or avoid), and
	•	Framing your evidence to shift opinions or decisions.

Consultants who can do both the technical analysis and the strategic framing are rare — and in high demand.
